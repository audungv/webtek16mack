          <h2> Testpersoner</h2>
            <p>
                A description of your efforts to reach testers that are similar to the website's intended audience and how successful you were (give the percentages of your tester audience once you aggregate their answers, e.g., 23% college students, 46% school administrators, etc.) If you are collecting age-ranges you can do the same. If you were able to do live testing with a few users, describe that as well.

            <h2> Oppsummering av tilbakemeldinger </h2>
            <p>
                A summary of the feedback you received organized by question type (design, navigation, content, usability, etc.). Highlight both positive comments and thoughtful criticism, your client's testimonial, etc.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h2> Vårt svar på tilbakemeldingene </h2>
            <p>
                Provide your response to the feedback. Concretely, describe what you could do (once the class is over) to address this feedback with changes in your design or implementation. You can also address why some of the raised issues or suggestions for improvements are difficult or impossible to tackle.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h2> Selvrefleksjon</h2>
            <p>
                Step back and reflect on the whole project experience and what you learned from it. Are there general lessons that you learned, beyond the nuts-and-bolts of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. We would like you to take this seriously and be thoughtful about your comments, but there is no right or wrong answer here, so don't feel that you have to flatter us or try to divine what we want to hear.
